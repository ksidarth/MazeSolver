# MazeSolver
This was a project I initially started for school, but after the semester ended I decided to add some other features.
The algorithm used to solve the maze is similar to depth first search, but is slightly different. The algorithm begins with all possible pathways
explored, then narrows them down by checking if they solve the maze. Kruskals algorithm is used to solve the maze, which you can observe in the code.
